*	Manages himself –
Prioritizes and handles taks

*	Professional
Brings value
Strives for excellence – continuous improving

*	Team player
Looks beyond his tasks
Selfless


### Excel

Understand -> solve -> implement -> test

Completing tasks
Solving bugs

#### Understanding the task – why is understanding the task importance ?

*	Having clear understanding
*	Specification document -> clear understanding of the task -> less bugs, minimize changes after coding begins, better time management. 
*	You understand it when you can explain it
*	System analyst -> 
  *	what does the user see ?
  *	how does each part behave ?
  *	what interaction is there with other components ?
  *	what are the edge cases, and how to handle them ?

thing of edge cases – help you the tests

document what you know

flow chart – use diagram or chart
edge cases – write document – scenario and handling columns

uml chart alternative 


#### Solving – what is the step to solving optimize

What is optimal solution

Why spend time on planning a solution ?

*	no reinventing the wheel – already there are optmal solution
*	write compatible code – naming conventions, project structure, 
*	no waste time on implementing sub-optimal solutions
*	not find later that solution doesn’t work 

example : use this plugin for table, because this is pros. It is simple to integrate. Have integrate to testing fast and simple.

What are the steps for reaching the optimal solution for a task ?

1 – define task technically – what are the scope(technical scops) and context
Technical scope – what arealdy exists ? what need to be done ?
If there are feature that you want to implement, then use it. If there is slightly different you need to refactor.
Context – 
*	parts of the system that interacts with your code – exception handling mechanism, locking mechanism. How to integrate.
*	Code you can learn from or use – read another codes.
*	Coding standards – naming conventiongs, file structure, etc etc.

2 – find optimal solution – 
*	What are some relevant solutions ? which solution is the optimal ? why ? – 
  *	Building from scratch
  *	Building from existing ones. Legacy code
  *	Which sorting, searching algorithms use. What kind of database schema
*	Comparing solutions, and pick the better solution.
  *	Criteria
    *	Cost
    *	Performance
    * Forward Compatibility
    *	Simplicity
    *	Security
    *	Completeness – handles all cases 
    *	Coding standards & conventions compatibility
    *	Etc.

*	Validate applicability – use PEOC (Proof of the concepts)minimum needed to handle it. Prototype. Is the chosen solution applicable ?

How to remember ?

*	Documenting – comments to the mock ups, 
*	Use algorithm/pseudo code – when there are complex logic
*	Write more Edge cases



#### Implementing the solution – good coding session

write code

before implementing

* be aware of all the task's details
* concentrate on the big picture
* the main flow is where you should start coding(solving big issues first and filling the minor issues later)

what is considered a good coding session ?
* concentrate solely on solving a specific issue
* clear image of what you're trying to accomplish

technical details missing, which you are uncertain

If you stop often to ask questions or assume things and tell yourseflt you'll check tehm later


where to start writing code ?

* the main flow, keep to do for details(wordings like messages, build specific ui )
* complete details later 


#### Testing – why , how and how much

do first test, 

flawless softwrae

why test ?
* what i did works perfectly
how to test ?
* QA - try to break things. change mind set.
* abuse your feature
* test mercilessly
* list of test cases 
how much to test ? 
* dedicated QA teams are an anti-pattern. testers should find nothing.Zero.Nada
* As much as it takes for you to be sure there aren't any bugs
when to test ?
* TDD - write the automated test before you write the actual code
* as soon as possible

#### Bugs

* know your toolbox - solving bugs - can save times. 
    * debugger
    * IDE

* Document
    * what you already tried - debug
    * prove bugs cause
    * where is the breaking the code
    * for Knowledge tranfer
    * confusion cause costs
    * what you need to documents :
    * what did you try, and what results did you get ?
    * what clues did you find ?
    * what do you plan on doing next?
    * everithing else that might help

* bug solving stages 
     
     * gather information - undestand the correct behavior
     * understand related functionality
     * find and understand the error message(logs, screen) if there is (read the error)
     * see for yourlself (the bug) (reproduce the bug)
     * find the exact point of failure (networking problem, amount of data problem) - narrow it down
     * read the code and black box test
 
* debugging prepartions
     * understand the flow of the code (stacktrace) - which class call which class, also for method or server
     * reprodce locally - start by seeing it break, then fix it
     * refactor to improve readbility, refactor to new function (not overdue it)

* Debug
     * Articulate (what you exactly knows)  
     * Doubt your assumptions (the problem can be in another place)
       * what did i assume to be working correctly and hence not check properly ?
       * could a problem there cause the symptoms i'm seeing ?
     * Every assumptions you validate makes you stand on more solid ground 
     * Every assumptions you invalidate changes your focus toward the real problem
     * Consider solving withous solving (instead debugging the library and fix, just change the library)    
     * Avoid changing code you don't undertand - sometimes, solving the problem will result in another problem
     * only change code you undestand

* Test
     * what you fixed works correctly
     * what did work correctly, still does (dependencies)  


good softwre - produces high quality softtware on time
* carpeter proverb - measure twice, cut once - spend more time on planning and less time on execution
      * always look for unclear issues, and make them clear.
      * always know where you are in the bigger picture.
      * always make sure what you know is available to you
* error can be costly

- miss feature, after production is pretty expensive.
- low quality is very expensive


### Learn
Set goals – learning techniques – build a plan

plan to get mastery
most cost effective way

lesson 1 : set yourfself goals 
set vision and goals

vision - where do you want to be , 1 , 5 or 10 years future.

goals - goals need to be smart

SPECIFIC - what exactly you want to achieve -> what improve
MEASURABLE - whats need to be done with what steps - 
Achievable - realistic goals - time, money - have resources
Relevant - releavant what you going to achieve
Time-bound - time interval

lesson 2 : know your resources

Time - 3 types of time
1 - free time in front of a computer - writing code
2 - time at work - still use time.
    - work in an organization
    - completing tasks
3 - free time not in front of computer
    - drive to work, train or walk. (moving time)

Time

* using it wisely(effectly)
* only what's relevant 
   * dont read or watch or do exercise courses that not is relevant with your goals or vision - that is waste of time.
* enjoyment and satisfaction are key
   * learning can be boring or unpleasant at times, but if in the end you feel it was worth it, then the entire experience was positive.
   * if you doensnt get any enjoyment or satisfaction, maybe it is time to try something else.

lesson 3 : techniques - theoretical

Reading
* books - learning through books - great way to qcquere specific, in-depth knowledge and undestarnding of concepts.
* blogs(like medium) - great way to find out the latest and greatest technolgoies, language, features, etc. keeping up to days
* other peoples code - great way to learn techniques you haven't thought about, as well as fin new features in that you werent aware of

Listening
* podcasts - you can listen when you drive or moving some place. trends, methodologies and concepts only.

watching
* online courses - showing actual code and giving explanation, not very effective. passive mode. actually wrinting code. given task is better to do labs. active learning is far more effective then passive learning. change speed 1.5x -> save a lot of time and focus more.


lesson 4 : techniques - practical

solving the same problem with different approach will you gain better perspective to know the best way code.

Code Kata - practice sessions - practice sessions that are designed to bring the practitioner to optimize his solving techniques by repeating the exericises over and over again, just as the original karate kata. 
* explorer the possibilities - compare the solutions, exploring and comparing different approaches

Games and challenges - you can see you code in action.
* Engaging and enjoyable
* code reviews - improve the code quality

Hackatons - gathering developers and other professionals to solve specific problem or challenge on specific time. few days
* learn by doing
* enjoyable

Contribute to open source - you take code written by others unfixable or add a feuature to it.
* coder review 
* reputation - passion and show spare time used to code 
* satisfaction

Code Reviews 
* free lessons 
* at work
* Stack exchange code reviews, q and a sites -> you can do code reviews here

Pet or Toy Project
* new technology that you are learning first. few hours or several months, alone or team
* free to experiment
* be creative
* belief in yourself
* start with something small and simple

lesson 5 : planning your path

1 - smart goals driven by your vision
2 - use 3 types of times
3 - theoretical learning
4 - practical learning

power of habits

used to do something
assign time -> assign specific time in you calendar

plan approaches

* objectives by timeframes - plan what you will do for each and every day of the week.
  * example : solve code kata every morning
  * drive the work listening pod cast.
  * objectives by timeframes
* All in - let youlself one goal and devote all the time you have to accomplish it 
  * complete my pet project by next month. (one single big goal to achieve)
* (Most Effective) Combination of the two - some habits do regularly and other than that, you have a big goal to which you devote all the rest of the time you have.  

set vision -> smart goals -> choose plan approach

Good learning session - give you value(time invest) and sticks with you(update your plan if you cannot stick it)

where you wnat to be in a few years ?
what are the most relevant topics ?
build a plan and stick to it

habits is key for success.

If a person studies a sbuject for 15 minutes a day in a year he will be an expert. In 5 years he will be a national expert - albert einstain

### Take the next step
Time management – code quality – the zone – stand out

advices to be better developer

#### lesson1 : time management 


1 - estimate how long the task will take
* you cannot estimate something that you don't understand it.
* if you have several tasks diving into code in order to estimate how long each of them will take is usually overkill. but you can do is give a rough estimate.
* if you are not familiar with the relevant part of the code, ask fellow developers that are familiar.
  * do we have infraestcture for sending mail 
2 - Make sure you have what you need as soon as possible -  task is dependent on an external resources like another task.
  * for each task you get always start by making sure you have everithing you need in order to complete it
  * if you are dependent on someone or something, that is a risk on the way to mitigate it is by getting whatever it is you need as soon as possible.
  * don't wait until the last moment to start looking for someone to answer your questions.
3 - If there are delays, reflect them to you manager
  * blockers
  * like assigning someone to help you or reassigning the teams tasks so that others who have some spare time will make up for the delay.
  * telling at last moment that you not going to make it, there is not much the manage can do.

ASAP 

"A problem you reported long before the deadline is a problem. A problem reported shortly before the deadline is a crisis"

steps :

managing single taks -> managing several tasks -> managing people.

you mitigate risks and eliminate waste of time, so does your team leader.

first managing yourself and after that manage others.

#### lesson2 : code quality

Every craftsman should be proud of his craft.

mastery - carpeter, jeweler, etc.
low quality you can see it.

software is not so. a piece of code can work for years even without bugs. 
lacking of quality will come into play is the price of changing it and in the price of fixing others components that work with it.

customer only see the code results, not the code itself.

Manifesto for software craftsmanship : 
* Not only working software, but also well-crafted software
* Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value
* Not only individuals and interactions, but also a community of professionals
* Not only customer collaboration, but also productive partnerships

 Maintenance typically consumes about 40 to 80 percent(60 percent average) of software costs.
 so high quality software is essential.
 
 you produce value to the company that can be converted to monetary profit.
 
 Profit is the deciding factor
 
 When recommending new technology 
 
 how long will it take to implement this technology in the project ?
 how long will it take you and other team members to learn it ?
 does this technology have known issues ? what are they ?
 is it stable ?
 What benefit will it bring to the project ?
 
 * Always aspire to write a high quality code as you can
 * The people who spend the money are the ones who should make the calls
 * Reflect the relevant information -> people ho make the decisions to take best decisitions
 
#### lesson3: saying no to your manager

* sometimes the person who assigns you a task doesn't understand it is full implications.(sometimes  simple task looked, it doesn't and can be more complicated)
* It's our duty to reflect that to our managers. managers take go or not to go decisitions.
* What the leader says is what counts

#### lesson4: the Zone

* The zone is a state of mind which is marked by a sense of calmness. there is a heghtened sense of awareness and focus. Actions seem effortless, and there is an incresed belief that your dreams or goals can become achievable and real. you are enjoying. -> sport originarited -> also in programming
* detach yourself of all distractions. focus. prevent interruptions - 
  * work early or leave work late (there wiil be no one who interrupt you)
  * use headphones
  * close all messaging applciations, outlook, zoom , etc, phone. -> no messages, no calls
  * no meetings
  * get everything you need - have all you need closely

* focus
  *  have clear goals - dont start a session before you know exactly what you are trying to achieve. can be waisting of your time.
  *  Devote yourself 

#### lesson5: stand out

* ask why - why, why , why, why -> find root cause  -> undestand the requirements
* help you team achieve it is goals - spend time to help junior devs.  do procedures - steps on cofluence.
  * take initiative. do more than what you have assigned.
*  become a guru - knowledge of the system. - choosing a technology, a business process, a library you use or an area in the code and getting to know it really well, be the person people come to when they want to work with it.
*  Lead - be proactive, be one aware of entire task. be the go to person to task. lead the task.
   *  make sure what you do is accepted by your teammates and is no t considered rude or unpleasant
*  Kaizen - continous improvement - with the time kaizen practice will be better than any one
   * number of bugs per task
   * time estimation accuracy
   * number of comments in code review
   * number of misunderstanding connection between sub tasks
 
 Did you get better on those parameters on your last task, compared with the task before that ?
 
 how do you improve ?
 
 * scale - 
   * number of bugs per task(or per x programming hours)
   * perentage of deviation from time estimation
   * number of comments in code reviews
   * number of unplanned changes to code you already wrote
 * Reflect - after every meaningful step you do. ask youlself, how did it go ?
   * be it a big task
   * critical bug you found or solve
   * a version completed
 * Awareness - constantly keeping in mind, trying to see if what you are doing can be done better
   *  was that conversation with the systems analyst or with our team leader effective ?
   *  was you decision to solve that bug the right call based on what you knew when you came to that decision ? is it still the right call now or should you reconsider ? 
   *  not everytime, but at some points, see the process as it occurs and be aware of the small steps as well

* time management - you cant estimate how long a task will take without understanding it. track your time. you should get what you need in order to complete your task as soon as possible. you should reflect any delay to your managers.
* code quality - you should be porud of what you do, the people who paying you decide what you do. our role to reflect what we know to them in order for them to make the best decisions.
* saying no to your manager - after you have relfected what you know to your manager,it is unprofessional to refuse a task.
* The zone - on some specific times you set yourself, the more distractions you will remove, the more productive you will be.
* Stand out - 
  * ask why about business requirements, specification documents and technical decisions, get depper undestanding about the task. 
  * stepping out of your personal tasks and helping your team achieve it is goals. 
  * becoming a guru on specific topic in such a way that you will be the person that people come to for a question or for advice. 
  * finding opportunities to take the lead when it is acceptable by your peers.
  * constantly improving

### Job Interview Tips

"Personal experience"

* technical skills for job interview
  * create new simple projects over and over again
  * google -> interview questions
  * google -> technolgies latest features
  * (basic) describe some technology -> main features, why i used x instead y. answer - why should i use this technology ? what are it is main features ?

* non-technical skills
  * Be the best version of you - Oren show - being the best, friendliest and nicest version of me. not to overdo it,.
  * Think of a challenge you have encontredered, and how you overcame it by being resourceful
  * Be talkative when you are stuck - how you will approach it

* Asking questions
  * junior dev - build is broken, why is that ? get error messages -> thre is a problem, what should i do ?
  * experience dev -trying to undestand -> the build is broken, i have the latest version , get a referecne expection in employee class. investigation done before.  -> there is a problem, here is what is causing it, what should i do ?  (lack of ability)
  * better experience dev - there is a problem. here is what is causing it, and here is a way to solve it , what should i do ?
  * senior dev -- there is a problem. here is what is causing it, and here are serveral ways to solve it, what should i do ?
  * best dev - there is a problem. here is what is causing it, and here are several ways to solve it, i recommend this way because of such and such criteria. what should i do ? 

- benefits of asking higher levels questions
- 
* you respect your teammate's time
* you make others respect you more
* you study as you go
* you are becoming independent

- Overcoming being stuck

* solve the problem manually - see pattern emerging -> pseudocode , test to see if you have expected answer.
* take a break - make some coffee, walk around building.
* articulate the problem precisely - what is exactly not working -> be very specific about the problem. check you assumptions. rubber duck debugging skills apply
* isolate the technical difficulty - online console - solve seprately in isolation
* ask a question on StackOverflow - will you describe what you triying to accomplish and what you have already tried.
* Thinking outside of the box  
  *  export a web page to pdf -> fix the code ? - debbug but cannot fix or stuck -> think outside of the box. switching library, or use browser ability to export pdf.
