Senior developer – no coding skills

Use sticky note – note the short cuts – use the shortcuts 
-	Ide – intellij idea, vs code

Googling – get best resources

Play courses 2x or 3x if you undestarnd it

How to learn

## Senior developer needs

*	Proficient - 
Writes high quality 
Aware of technologies and methodologies
Finds and solves bugs quickly and efficiently

*	Manages himself –
Prioritizes and handles taks

*	Professional
Brings value
Strives for excellence – continuous improving

*	Team player
Looks beyond his tasks
Selfless


### Excel

Understand -> solve -> implement -> test

Completing tasks
Solving bugs

Understanding the task – why is understanding the task importance ?
*	Having clear understanding
*	Specification document -> clear understanding of the task -> less bugs, minimize changes after coding begins, better time management. 
*	You understand it when you can explain it
*	System analyst -> 
  *	what does the user see ?
  *	how does each part behave ?
  *	what interaction is there with other components ?
  *	what are the edge cases, and how to handle them ?

thing of edge cases – help you the tests

document what you know

flow chart – use diagram or chart
edge cases – write document – scenario and handling columns

uml chart alternative 


Solving – what is the step to solving optimize
What is optimal solution

Why spend time on planning a solution ?

*	no reinventing the wheel – already there are optmal solution
*	write compatible code – naming conventions, project structure, 
*	no waste time on implementing sub-optimal solutions
*	not find later that solution doesn’t work 

example : use this plugin for table, because this is pros. It is simple to integrate. Have integrate to testing fast and simple.

What are the steps for reaching the optimal solution for a task ?

1 – define task technically – what are the scope(technical scops) and context
Technical scope – what arealdy exists ? what need to be done ?
If there are feature that you want to implement, then use it. If there is slightly different you need to refactor.
Context – 
*	parts of the system that interacts with your code – exception handling mechanism, locking mechanism. How to integrate.
*	Code you can learn from or use – read another codes.
*	Coding standards – naming conventiongs, file structure, etc etc.

2 – find optimal solution – 
*	What are some relevant solutions ? which solution is the optimal ? why ? – 
  *	Building from scratch
  *	Building from existing ones. Legacy code
  *	Which sorting, searching algorithms use. What kind of database schema
*	Comparing solutions, and pick the better solution.
  *	Criteria
    *	Cost
    *	Performance
    * Forward Compatibility
    *	Simplicity
    *	Security
    *	Completeness – handles all cases 
    *	Coding standards & conventions compatibility
    *	Etc.

*	Validate applicability – use PEOC (Proof of the concepts)minimum needed to handle it. Prototype. Is the chosen solution applicable ?

How to remember ?

*	Documenting – comments to the mock ups, 
*	Use algorithm/pseudo code – when there are complex logic
*	Write more Edge cases



### Implementing the solution – good coding session

### Testing – why , how and how much

### Bugs

### Learn
Set goals – learning techniques – build a plan

### Take the next step
Time management – code quality – the zone – stand out

### Conclusion
